WIP. It's hard for me to find time/stay motivated to read because of how busy I am. End goal is to have an app that helps me stay on track with my reading in ways such as sending reminders, setting goals, and engaging with thought questions. Hopefully can add full-featured integration with sites like Goodreads and Amazon.
